  I
  I would like to thank my advisors, Sr\dj{}an Krsti\'c and François Hublet, for making my thesis project possible in the first place and for supporting me endlessly during the last six months. You have been strongly invested in my project, and I felt supported at all times. I am very grateful for your time and your patience.
  I would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to Joshua Schneider: your profound insight into MonPoly and MFODL was tremendously helpful. Time and again, you steered the project in the right direction and helped me appreciate the purpose of my work.

  Finally, I thank the professors at ETH Zurich, especially Prof. David Basin, Prof. Peter Müller, Prof. Zhendong Su, and Prof. Ueli Maurer. Your lectures were pure joy and taught me all the fundamentals I needed for my thesis.
